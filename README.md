# ml-titanic

## Description

The titanic was a famous passenger ship that tragically sunk in the middle of the ocean during its maiden voyage, leading to the death of majority of passengers on board. "While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others." - ***Kaggle***

## Objective


This project aims to build a model that predicts what factors might have led to some people surviving or not. The dataset consists of some information on each of the passengers and whether or not they survived or not. - ***This constitutes the training dataset***

Some of the passengers do not have a lable (whether or not they survived). The model should be able to predict whether those [unlabled] passengers survived or not.
